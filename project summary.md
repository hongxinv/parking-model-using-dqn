The goal of this project is to develop a model that simulates an agent (a car) navigating through a parking lot to park an available parking spot. The model will utilise Deep Q-Networks to train the agents. The parking environment is semi-procedurally generated, maintaning its overall structure with slight variations, such as occupied parking spots. The performance metrics would be evaluated based on metrics such as time taken to park, distance from starting point and collisions.
